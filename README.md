## Storm is a modern torrent client built with Electron and React.

Storm comes with the idea of <b>change the way we see torrent clients</b>, because all of them always have those typical tables with a lot of data that most of the regular users doesn't understand it all, including me. I tried to put just the necessary features with a beautiful UI/UX.

> Storm is currently in beta status and only available for MacOS and Linux, but go ahead and try it!
